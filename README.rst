Writing a Simple DSL in Python
==============================

This is the source code for a tutorial I wrote for Dan Bader's blog
at `dbader.org <https://dbader.org/>`_: Writing A Simple DSL in Python: A tutorial on
creating a domain specific language.

Dan's spent a lot of time putting together a ton of very high-quality resources on his
site `dbader.org <https://dbader.org/>`_ and
YouTube channel `Python Training by Dan Bader <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI0vQvr9aFn27yR6Ej6n5UA>`_.
